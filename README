Small example using Diffie-Hellman to establish a secure key and AES with that key to exchange the secure data.

Diffie Hellman
--------------

In this key exchange the two users estabilish a shared secret
in a secure manner also if someone is eavesdropping.

In this Django example the two endpoints are the server
and the javascript client side implementation: the server
calculate the g and p parameters and communicate the
A parameter with the web page embedding them in some
javascript values.

The web page a this point calculates its parameter, embed it
in a hidden form field and when the user submit this to the
server the negotiation is finished.

Problem
-------

A know problem with DH is the fact that this negotiation is
not authenticated, so is possible to be attacked with a MitM.

Also the javascript and the web page could be substituited with
tampered ones making unreliable using it for life threatening
situation.

DON'T USE THIS CODE, IS UNSECURE AS HELL!!!!1!!!!!!
